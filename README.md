I went with an ocean themed pinball. It started off as me wanting the ball to be a pufferfish with the ability to expand and shrink. I thought of it as a way to give the player more control over the behavior of the ball while it bounces around and to somewhat limit the amount of time where the player does nothing (although it is cool to see the ball bounce around randomly). I tried to design the board such that there are areas where a smaller pufferfish shines, and the vice versa. There are channels where only the smaller pufferfish can roll through, meanwhile the puffed up pufferfish can achieve higher heights more easily and can bounce like crazy within the bumpers. I struggled with making the assets. I drew everything in Procreate and pretty much eyeballed everything. The edges on the board are no where as smooth as I wanted it to be, and it was hard making minor changes to the board with my workflow. I was thinking about using Illustrator but didn't have the time to learn a whole new software. Working on the project, I think I learned how to structure my code better and to be more organized in the editor. I also learned about scuba diving gear. The audio for the game feels incomplete. I couldn't find a lot of the sounds I wanted online. Had I given myself more time I would have went to record them myself.
